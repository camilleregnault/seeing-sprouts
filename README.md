## Supported Browsers

## Supported Veggies

This project was initially created to celebrate the sprout. But now, [thanks to the community](https://github.com/carolstran/seeing-sprouts/graphs/contributors), there's support for more vegetables, nutrient-dense fruits and other veggie-like things people enjoy.
